# SOC-Nmap-Lab
“Network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment of Metasploitable2 using Nmap — SOC lab project.”

## Overview
This repository contains a network reconnaissance and vulnerability identification lab using Nmap on a Metasploitable2 target. The lab demonstrates hands-on SOC skills including host discovery, port scanning, OS detection, and vulnerability assessment.

## Repository Contents
- **SOC_Report.pdf** — Final SOC report documenting findings and risk analysis
- **screenshots/** — Supporting screenshots of Nmap scans
- **outputs/** — Raw Nmap scan outputs in `.nmap` and `.xml` formats

## Lab Highlights
- Identification of live hosts in the network
- Open port and service detection
- OS detection and version mapping
- Vulnerability identification (vsFTPd backdoor CVE-2011-2523)
- Risk scoring with CVSS-style assessment
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for key findings

## Notes
All scans were performed in a controlled lab environment using intentionally vulnerable systems. No unauthorized scanning was performed.
